        <h2>About</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            I'm studying Computer Engineering as part of the Commonwealth Honors
            College at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. I have hands-on
            experience in Software Engineering and Machine Learning through
            coursework, projects, and certifications.
          </li>
          <li>
            I primarily work in Python, using it for full-stack web development,
            data processing, and machine learning projects. I also have solid
            experience with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for building clean,
            functional web interfaces.
          </li>
          <li>
            I'm looking for a Summer 2026 Internship where I can contribute to
            real, industry-grade work, learn from experienced professionals, and
            continue to sharpen my technical skills.

            <h3>PokéLab</h3>
            <strong> ReactJS, Flask, SQLAlchemy, RESTful API </strong>
            <p>
              I built a full-stack web application using Flask for the backend,
              SQLAlchemy for the database, and React for the frontend. As you
              can see in the repository and demo, I implemented user
              authentication and account management for personalized team
              building and designed an explore page, letting users collaborate.
              I also implemented a team analyzing algorithm with Python that
              takes type machups and Pokémon strength into consderation for
              evaluation. There are also Pokémon detail pages showing types and
              stats. I applied RESTful API principles and relational data
              modeling to manage users, teams, and Pokémon. This project
              showcases full-stack development concentrated at making a
              user-focused product.

            <h3>Fantasy Football Helper</h3>
            <strong> Pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, Scikit-Learn, Streamlit </strong>
            <p>
              Built a Machine Learning web app analyzing 10 years of NFL data
              (2014-2024) to deliver fantasy football insights and predictions.
              I implemented KMeans clustering to group similar player-seasons
              and uncover season trajectories cross WR/RB/TE positions. I also
              trained Random Forest and Linear Regression models to predict
              player famtasy points per game with feature engineering on usage
              and efficienty metrics. I also designed visualizations using
              matplotlib and seaborn to highlight feature importance, and
              constructed a Streamlit dashboard to make these analytics
              accessible to non-technical users. This project showcases an
              end-to-end ML workflow, from scraping and cleaning of data, to
              model training, evaluation, and deployment. I implemented both
              supervised and unsupervised learning for Fantasy Football Helper.

            <h3>Student App</h3>
            <strong> Flask, SQLAlchemy, RESTful API, ChartJS </strong>
            <p>
              Student App is a full-stack web application made with Flask,
              SQLAlchemy, and templated HTML/CSS for course, assignment, and
              study tracking. I added user login, class/assignment management
              (add, edit, toggle completion, delete), and a calendar view of
              upcoming deadlines. I also integrated a Pomodoro timer that logs
              work sessions, tracks streaks, and visualizes progress with
              Chart.js charts. I also made a recommendation script in Python to
              suggest priority assignments, combining backend logic, database
              design, and interactive visualizations.
